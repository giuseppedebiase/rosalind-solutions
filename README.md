# Rosalind
Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving.

## Python Village
"If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold."
